# Welcome to the Decentralized Digital Poststate

We are creating a Decentralized Digital Poststate that will provide a positive and constructive example of how to address existing economic, social, and cultural-psychological problems!

We are individuals from around the world residing in various states' territories, but we spend most of our time on the internet.

Despite our differences in gender, age, languages spoken, and worldviews, we do not engage in conflict or discrimination against one another on any grounds.

The internet has enabled us to form Digital Communities that cater to our needs more effectively than the states within whose territories we reside. Everyone has a genuine right to vote, and we assist and cooperate with each other. Most importantly, we feel safe!

What may be considered utopian in traditional states is the norm in our Digital Communities.

Of course, this does not imply that we are without problems, but within our Digital Communities, everyone has the opportunity to participate in addressing these issues.

The creation of a Decentralized Digital Poststate is not only a solution to the problems of our Digital Communities but also an effort to demonstrate how easily we can improve everyone's lives!

## The Main Idea
### The Web3-Personality and the Decentralized Digital Poststate
- The right to self-identification and its protection
- The development of the internet and the emergence of blockchains have given rise to new digital forms of interaction among people. Now, individuals in different state territories can connect and interact in digital spaces.
- These interactions lead to novel forms of social and economic cooperation, resulting in new cultural behaviors and self-identification among individuals.
- In the digital realm, individuals from different countries increasingly identify as Web3-personalities, whose social, economic, and cultural activities predominantly occur on the internet, rather than in physical spaces.
- The lives of Web3-persons are more influenced by interactions within Digital Communities than by their interactions with the state in whose territory they reside.

Almost all traditional nations have their respective states that, at least in official documents, claim to protect their citizens' interests and rights. However, Web3-persons lack an institution to safeguard their rights and interests.

It appears that the time has come to rectify this and establish an institution dedicated to protecting the rights and interests of Web3-individuals.

Our Decentralized Digital Poststate, built on blockchain technology, addresses issues common to all traditional states while incorporating functionalities that are unfeasible within traditional states.

POSTHUMAN BLOCKCHAIN is a social, economic, and cultural experiment!

POSTHUMAN BLOCKCHAIN serves as a bridge between Web2 and Web3, a link between the Material World and the Digital World!

POSTHUMAN BLOCKCHAIN is a Decentralized Digital Poststate!

## Foundations of the Decentralized Digital Poststate
**Poststate for Citizens, not Citizens for Poststate!**

The most crucial value for the Decentralized Digital Poststate is its Citizens!

A Decentralized Digital Poststate exists for the benefit of its Citizens, and not the other way around!

Citizens (and the protection of their rights and interests) are the primary motivation behind the creation of the Decentralized Digital Poststate!

The Poststate is a tool that Citizens use to safeguard their rights and interests:
- The Poststate cannot manage, coerce, or dictate how Citizens should act in any manner.
- The Poststate should not possess any functionality that could infringe upon or violate the rights and interests of Citizens.
- If there is any potential for the Poststate to compromise the rights and interests of Citizens, it is the duty of Citizens to reconfigure the Poststate. The functionality for reformatting the Poststate must be integrated into its design.

The foundations of the Poststate can evolve and expand over time, based on the interests and will of the Citizens.
